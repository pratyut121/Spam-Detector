# Spam detection using Naive Bayes Classifier

Naive Bayes is a simple technique for constructing classifiers: models that assign class labels to problem instances, represented as vectors of feature values, where the class labels are drawn from some finite set. 
Naive Bayes classification is a simple probability algorithm based on the fact, that all features of the model are independent. In the context of the spam filter, we suppose, that every word in the message is independent of all other words and we count them with the ignorance of the context.
